# LiteBrite XL

This is my attempt at making a LiteBrite with Ruby on Rails. Yeah, that's right. That toy from your childhood with the different color pegs that you use to basically make doodles with. It's gonna be interesting. Yee. 

Oh, another note; I have no idea how to store the LiteBrite doodles right now. Like I said, gonna be interesting. Whoop.
